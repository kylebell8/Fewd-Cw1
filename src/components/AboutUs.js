<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We are a small local chain of cafes specialising in simple wholesome, locally
sourced dishes.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s easy to dismiss chain restaurants in favour of a one-off but, sometimes,
more can mean better. We are a homegrown business that proved so popular we outgrew our
original location and expanded to meet demand. Increased size means we can offer even better
value</p>
<p>We take pride in providing straightforward, good value food.</p>
